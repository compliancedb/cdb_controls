log_approval:
Has this
		--env MERKELY_SRC_REPO_ROOT=${MERKELY_SRC_REPO_ROOT} \
		--volume ${PWD}:/src \
If MERKELY_SRC_REPO_ROOT is not /src/ then the volume-mount will be wrong...
If we want the Makefile target to be reusable as is we could drop
MERKELY_SRC_REPO_ROOT and require the volume-mount to always be /src


Command Names:?
---------------
log_evidence   ===> log_generic_evidence?
     I presume the evidence_type env-var must match Merkelypipe.json "template"
     Could we find a name based on that?
log_test       ===> log_junit_xml_evidence
     Also has an evidence_type env-var. Same question.
log_deployment ===> log_image_registry_push
     Words: deployment is something different to me, eg of an image to staging so its _runnable_ somewhere
log_approval   ===> log_release_approval
     Will we want approval of different things/steps?  What exactly is this approving?
control_deployment ==> ????
     Feels too generic ????



In main.yml
- name: Build and push Docker image         - name: Build and push Docker image to dockerhub
- name: Get tagged Docker image name        - name: ?????
- name: Declare Merkely pipeline            - name: Merkely: Declare Pipeline
- name: Log Docker image to Merkely         - name: Merkely: Log Event: Docker image existence.
- name: Log image deployment to Merkely     - name: Merkely: Log Event: Docker image pushed to dockerhub registry.
- name: Run tests                           - name: Run tests
- name: Log test results to Merkely         - name: Merkely: Log Evidence: JUnit xml test summary.
- name: Log coverage evidence to Merkely    - name: Merkely: Log Evidence: JUnit coverage summary.


It feels like this wants to be more interleaved but can't be at present
because you have to build and push an image before you can gets its digest.
Presumably if we created our own private image registry we could push images
to it (temporarily?) and get their digest.

Is there a difference (compliance wise) between the JUnit xml test summary
and the JUnit coverage summary?

Still need to create Merkelypipe.json file(s) in root dir.


Parked...
=========

Should declare_merkely_pipeline go at very start of main.yml
Even before building and pushing the image?

main.yml has this (at the end)
source tmp/coverage/unit/htmlcov/test_coverage.txt
source tmp/coverage/unit/htmlcov/test_cases.txt
These would be better as .sh files?

CommandError should be named ChangeError.
And moved out of commands/ module to break cyclic dependencies

tests/unit/test_m_defaulted_env_var.py's 1st line is this:
from commands import CommandError # avoid cyclic dependency
Look into solving this cyclic-dependency properly.

Some tests are producing output when they run.
eg tests/unit/test_m_log_approval.py

Check when using pathed-filename to get sha for that
cdb and merkely behave the same regarding only showing
the basename of the pathed-filename.

Should create a source/ dir and move everything into it.

load_json() should be in context to allow easy stubbing.

Context() ctor should have keyword args.

Could look for *unused* env-vars starting with MERKELY_
and report warnings...

Command could start by printing list of environment variables and their type?

Print 'success' at end of successful command run?

Look into how Python recommended style for abstract-base-classes.

Mock fingerprinters code in tests/utils could be collapsed using
multiple inheritance.

Commands should return the triple(method,url,payload)
and a 2nd step is to do the http get/post/put.
This would simplify the tests by not needing the
dry_run() unless they call main.

As a general principle, for anything in a docstring,
consider whether it should be part of the living documentation.

Once living documentation is in place, warning/error messages can
include targeted urls.

properties/methods that exist in abstract-base-classes only to be
overridden are marked # pragma: no cover
Maybe add programmer-tests for these and remove the pragmas.
