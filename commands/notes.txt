log_approval:
Has this
		--env MERKELY_SRC_REPO_ROOT=${MERKELY_SRC_REPO_ROOT} \
		--volume ${PWD}:/src \
If MERKELY_SRC_REPO_ROOT is not /src/ then the volume-mount will be wrong...
If we want the Makefile target to be reusable 'as-is' we could drop
MERKELY_SRC_REPO_ROOT (which defaults to /src) and require the
volume-mount to always be /src ?




Command Names:?
---------------
log_evidence   ===> log_X_evidence ?
     The name feels very generic?
     I presume the evidence_type env-var must match Merkelypipe.json "template"
     Could we find a name based on that?

log_test       ===> log_junit_xml_evidence ?
     Again the name feels very generic.
     Also has an evidence_type env-var.

log_deployment ===> log_image_registry_push
     Words: deployment is something different to me, eg of an image to staging so its _runnable_ somewhere

log_approval   ===> log_release_approval
     Again the name feels very generic.
     Will we want approval of different things/steps?
     What exactly is this approving?

nothing        ===> control_deployment ==> ????
     Feels too generic ????



In main.yml
- name: Build and push Docker image         - name: Build and push Docker image to dockerhub
- name: Get tagged Docker image name        - name: ?????
- name: Declare Merkely pipeline            - name: Merkely: Declare Pipeline
- name: Log Docker image to Merkely         - name: Merkely: Log Event: Docker image existence.
- name: Log image deployment to Merkely     - name: Merkely: Log Event: Docker image pushed to dockerhub registry.
- name: Run tests                           - name: Run tests
- name: Log test results to Merkely         - name: Merkely: Log Evidence: JUnit xml test summary.
- name: Log coverage evidence to Merkely    - name: Merkely: Log Evidence: JUnit coverage summary.



Is there a difference (compliance wise) between the JUnit xml test summary
and the JUnit coverage summary?

merkely/change repo still need to create Merkelypipe.json file(s) in root dir.


Parked...
=========

builders could be implemented using __init_subclass__

Put declare_merkely_pipeline go at very start of main.yml
Even before building and pushing the image?

Check when using pathed-filename to get sha for that
cdb and merkely behave the same regarding only showing
the basename of the pathed-filename.

Create a source/ dir and move everything into it.

load_json() should be in context to allow easy stubbing.

Context() should be named Externals.

Context() should have keyword args?

Provide Log in External, get Commands to return (method,url,payload)
and do http as separate step.

Could look for *unused* env-vars starting with MERKELY_
and report warnings...

Command could start by printing list of environment variables and their type?

Look into how Python recommended style for abstract-base-classes.

Mock fingerprinters code in tests/utils could be collapsed using
multiple inheritance.

Commands should return the triple(method,url,payload)
and a 2nd step is to do the http get/post/put.
This would simplify the tests by not needing the
dry_run() unless they call main.

As a general principle, for anything in a docstring,
consider whether it should be part of the living documentation.

Once living documentation is in place, warning/error messages can
include targeted urls.
