Command Names:?
---------------
log_evidence   ===> log_generic_evidence?
     I presume the evidence_type env-var must match Merkelypipe.json "template"
     Could we find a name based on that?
log_test       ===> log_junit_xml_evidence
     Also has an evidence_type env-var. Same question.
log_deployment ===> log_image_registry_push
     main.yml says "Log image deployment to Merkely" but to me
     deployment is something difference, eg of an image to staging so its _runnable_ somewhere
     Change text to "Log image pushed to Registry in Merkely"
log_approval   ===> log_release_approval
     We may want approval of different things/steps?
control_deployment ==> ???? but feels too generic ????


Presumably if we created our own private image registry
we could push images to it (temporarily?) so that we
could get their digest. This would remove an ordering constraint.

Still need to create Merkelypipe.json file(s) in root dir.


Parked...

Should declare_merkely_pipeline go at very start of main.yml
Even before building and pushing the image?


main.yml has this (at the end)
source tmp/coverage/unit/htmlcov/test_coverage.txt
source tmp/coverage/unit/htmlcov/test_cases.txt
These would be better as .sh files?

Remove Command suffix from command names.
Rename command abc base class as ABC?

CommandError should be named ChangeError.
And moved out of commands/ module to break cyclic dependencies

Some tests are producing output when they run.
eg tests/unit/test_m_log_approval.py

tests/unit/test_m_defaulted_env_var.py's 1st line is this:
from commands import CommandError # avoid cyclic dependency
Look into solving this cyclic-dependency properly.

Check when using pathed-filename to get sha for that
cdb and merkely behave the same regarding only showing
the basename of the pathed-filename.

Should create a source/ dir and move everything into it.

load_json() should be in context to allow easy stubbing.

Context() ctor should have keyword args.

Could look for unused env-vars starting with MERKELY_
and report warnings...

Command could start by printing list of environment variables and their type.

Print 'success' at end of successful command run?

Look into how Python recommended style for abstract-base-classes.

Mock fingerprinters code in tests/utils could be collapsed using
multiple inheritance.

Mock fingerprinters should print stack-trace if exception comes
through __exit__()

Commands should return the triple(method,url,payload)
and a 2nd step is to do the http get/post/put.
This would simplify the tests by not needing the
dry_run() everywhere.

As a general principle, for anything in a docstring,
consider whether it should be part of the living documentation.

Once living documentation is in place, warning/error messages can
include targeted urls.

properties/methods that exist in abstract-base-classes only to be
overridden are marked # pragma: no cover
Maybe add programmer-tests for these and remove the pragmas.
