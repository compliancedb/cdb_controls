bitbucket-pipes-toolkit==1.6.4

This pulls in cerberus.
This causes 6 repeats of this warning:

DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated since Python 3.3,and in 3.9 it will stop working

Upgrading to the latest bitbucket-pipes-toolkit
(2.1.0 at the time of writing https://pypi.org/project/bitbucket-pipes-toolkit/#history)
does not solve this.

You can remove the warnings by adding this:

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings(action="ignore",
                        message=".*Using or importing the ABCs.*",
                        category=DeprecationWarning)

to the top of pipe.py before the line:
from bitbucket_pipes_toolkit import Pipe, get_logger
