Could look for unused env-vars starting with MERKELY_
and report warnings...

Command could start by printing list of environment variables and their type.

Mock fingerprinters code in tests/utils could be collapsed using
multiple inheritance.

Commands should return the triple(method,url,payload)
and a 2nd step is to do the http get/post/put.
This would simplify the tests by not needing the
dry_run() everywhere.

As a general principle, for anything in a docstring,
consider whether it should be part of the living documentation.

Once living documentation is in place, warning/error messages can
include targeted urls.
