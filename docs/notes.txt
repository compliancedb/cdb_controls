Check when using pathed-filename to get sha for that
cdb and merkely behave the same regarding only showing
the basename of the pathed-filename.

Should create a source/ dir and move everything into it.

load_json() should be in context to allow easy stubbing.

Context() ctor should have keyword args.

Could look for unused env-vars starting with MERKELY_
and report warnings...

Command could start by printing list of environment variables and their type.

Print 'success' at end of successful command run?

Look into how Python recommended style for abstract-base-classes.

Mock fingerprinters code in tests/utils could be collapsed using
multiple inheritance.

Commands should return the triple(method,url,payload)
and a 2nd step is to do the http get/post/put.
This would simplify the tests by not needing the
dry_run() everywhere.

As a general principle, for anything in a docstring,
consider whether it should be part of the living documentation.

Once living documentation is in place, warning/error messages can
include targeted urls.

properties/methods that exist in abstract-base-classes only to be
overridden are marked # pragma: no cover
Maybe add programmer-tests for these and remove the pragmas.
